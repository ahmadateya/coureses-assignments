-- Problem

-- Compute intersting statistics on the ratings of content on a per-decade basis.
-- Details: Get the average rating (rounded to two decimal places), top rating, min rating, and the number of releases in each decade.
-- Exclude titles which have not been premiered (i.e. where premiered is NULL). 
-- Print the relevant decade in a fancier format by constructing a string that looks like this: 1990s. 
-- Order the decades first by their average rating in a descending fashion and secondly by the decade, ascending, to break ties.
-- Your output should have the format: DECADE|AVG_RATING|TOP_RATING|MIN_RATING|NUM_RELEASES
